    <p>health is wealth: 
    "The first wealth is health" wrote the American 
    philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1860. His statement 
    is a reminder that a good life - meaning the well-being of 
    people and communities as well as economies - can only be 
    built on sound foundations. </p>
